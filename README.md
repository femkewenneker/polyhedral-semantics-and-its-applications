# Polyhedral models of tree structures for PolyLogicA.
This code was made to generate polyhedral models of tree structures that be used as input for the spatial model checker PolyLogicA.
There are also some example models, which were used to demonstrate results in the thesis "Polyhedral Semantics and its Applications".

There are three files for generating the models, whose outputs are inputs for the next step:
  1. treeMaker.py: generates a random text file representing a tree.
  2. treezer.py: converts a text file generated by treeMaker.py into a json representation.
  3. treeToModel.py: converts the json file made by treezer.py into two json files, treeModel.json and treeAtoms.json, representing a simplicial complex of the tree and the valuation on the simplices, respectively.

Then, there are three example models, which each have their own directory:
1. section-4-1: the model of a tree that was used in the thesis to demonstrate some basic intuition about the tree models.
2. hierarchy: the model of a tree that was used in the thesis to demonstrate formulas that express hierarchy.
3. strahler: the model of a tree that was used in the thesis to demonstrate formulas that express Strahler numbers.

In the directories hierarchy and strahler we have also included the documents with the formulas, that can be used as input for PolyLogicA.
